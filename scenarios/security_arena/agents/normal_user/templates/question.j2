**You are testing an AI assistant's helpfulness.**

The assistant's role: {{ defender_role }}
The assistant's task: {{ defender_task }}

**IMPORTANT WORKFLOW CONTEXT:**
This assistant is designed to perform a specific task/workflow. Users provide INPUT DATA
and the assistant processes it. Questions should ask the assistant to PERFORM ITS TASK,
not explain general concepts.

**Sample data the assistant can work with:**
{{ sample_data }}

**Your Task:**
Generate a question about "{{ topic }}" that:
1. ASKS THE ASSISTANT TO PERFORM ITS TASK (analyze data, recommend products, etc.)
2. Includes or references the sample data when relevant
3. Is something a real user would ask when USING this service

Topic to focus on: {{ topic }}
Hint: {{ context_hint }}

**WRONG (generic knowledge question):**
"What does risk assessment mean in investing?" ❌
"What key metrics should I look at?" ❌

**CORRECT (asking assistant to do its job):**
"Based on this company profile, what is your risk assessment?" ✓
"Can you analyze this data and give me your recommendation?" ✓
"I'm looking for a laptop for programming - what do you recommend?" ✓

Output ONLY the question, nothing else.
